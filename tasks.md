# Task: Clarify Next.js vs Vite Direction

## Context
The project is currently a **React + Vite** application with **Clerk** authentication already successfully implemented. The user has just provided strict guidelines for adding Clerk to a **Next.js App Router** application.

## Objectives
1.  Acknowledge the provided Next.js guidelines.
2.  Highlight that the current project is **React (Vite)**, not Next.js.
3.  Determine if the user wants to:
    *   [ ] Continue with the existing working React+Vite app.
    *   [ ] Migrate the frontend to Next.js (Significant refactor).
    *   [ ] Create a new Next.js project.

## Next Steps
*   **WAIT** for user confirmation before executing any Next.js related code.
*   **MAINTAIN** the current working React+Vite state.
